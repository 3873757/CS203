             Analysis and design  for tic tac toe

ANALYSIS PHASE
we need two class 
1.tictactoe class-------System class
    //here decleration of board
    //decleration of player we will use it in change player method
2.main class    ------------tester
//tictactoe object will be created here
  
3.methods needs to be defined in system class
                   1.public TicTacToe()//loads the boadr
                   2. public void initializeBoard()//set rest the board
                             for loop will added here
                   3. public void printBoard()
                   4. public checkForWin()//it checks if there is winner
                   5. public void changePlayer()//for back and forth
 DESIGNE phase
  PRINT BOARD METHOD 
board = new char[3][3]; TREEE BY THREE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAY
LABELING CURRENT PLAYER AS p1;
INTIALIZING THE BOARD USING DOUBLE FOR LOOP
  FOR I = 0;I LESSTHAN 3
  FOR J = 0;J LESS THAN 3
  BOARD[I][J]='-'
RINT BOARD //BOARD WILL BE CREATED
THSI LOOP WILL IMPLEMET FOR ROW AND COLUMN,
MORE LOOPS WILL IMPLEMNTED HERE
  RESET METHOD
FOR LOOP FOR CHECKING IF BORD IS FULL AND HAS TRUE FALSE RETUN VALUE
  WINC CHECK METHOD
 BASICALLY IT WILL CHECK CELLS ARE FULL AND SAME VALUE
 WE USE FOR BOOLEAN CHECING VAL AND RETUN WIN
  PLAYER CHNGE METHOD
IF STATEMENT THAT CHECKS
